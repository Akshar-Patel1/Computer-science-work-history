Do now:
public class HelloWorld {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Prints "Hello, World" in the terminal window.
System.out.println("Hello, World");
}
}



1. Type above code by using comments and good indentation in replit.com ID
2
Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omitmainStringHelloWorldSystem.outprintln

3Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omitthe ;the first "the second "the first {the second {the first }the second }
4Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you misspell (by, say, omitting the second letter)mainStringHelloWorldSystem.outprintln5I typed in the following program. It compiles fine, but when I execute it, I get the error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main. What am I doing wrong?
public class Hello {
public static void main() {
System.out.println("Doesn't execute");
}
}



What I wrote:

When emitting any of those words the compiler return an error code with the code 1 (error: <identifier> expected)
When removing ; or any of those quotes or brackets it says that the letter is missing and points to where it is missing. (error: ';' expected)
When trying to run the code it returns an “error: cannot find symbol” and points to where it is wrong.
The program doesn’t run because the code is missing the String[] args after main inside the parentheses.
