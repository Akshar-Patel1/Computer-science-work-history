Do Now:
Int, double and boolean are primitive data types
Int is a primitive data type while integer is a wrapper class and can call in-built methods defined in the class.

Explain why Integer.parseInt("10") is valid and
int.parseInt("10") not valid

Int does not work because int is a primitive type which can only store binary values in it while integer is more flexible because it stores it in a references so it can parse while int canâ€™t


Class activity
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args){
  Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.print("Enter student name: ");
  String studentName = scan.nextLine();
  System.out.print("Enter first test grade: ");
  int firstGrade = scan.nextInt();
  System.out.print("Enter second test grade: ");
  int secondGrade = scan.nextInt();
  System.out.print("Enter third test grade: ");
  int thirdGrade = scan.nextInt();
  System.out.println(studentName + " average grade is " + (firstGrade + secondGrade + thirdGrade / 3));
 
 }
}
