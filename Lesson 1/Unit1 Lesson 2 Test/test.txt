Name  Akshar Patel               Grade _______________
public class HelloWorld {

1 . If we use replit.com IDE,    
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}

Questions:
If you save the program, what kind of file will be saved? The file will be saved as a .java file
How to compile the program in the replit.com console?
To compile the file you do “javac HelloWorld.java”
If no error, what kind file will be produced?
A .class file will be produced after compiling
How to run the program? (execution of program)
To run the program you have to run “java HelloWorld”
If you use HollowWord, instead of HolloWorld and use
javac HollowWord.java, any error? The console will say an error with the file name will appear in console

If you type public static vid main(String [] args), any error message?
      There is an error message because the code is missing a {} and void is miss spelled. It should be: 
public static void main(String[] args) {

    }


      
2. Write a program that uses two input statements to get two words as input. Then, print the words on one line separated by a space. Your program's output should only include the two words and a space between them.
Hint: To print both words on one line, remember that you can concatenate (add) two phrases by using the + symbol.  Don't forget that you'll need to add a space between the words as well.
Sample Run
Enter a word: Good
Enter a word: morning
Good morning
Code example:
https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_user_input.asp

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String x = scan.nextLine();
        String y = scan.nextLine();
        System.out.println(x + " " + y);
    }
}

3. Modify above program by using args[0] and args[1]
Same Run
Your java program is TwoWords.java
When you run program
Java TwoWords  Good moring
(display)
Good mroning

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String x = args[0];
        String y = args[1];
        System.out.println(x + " " + y);
    }
}
