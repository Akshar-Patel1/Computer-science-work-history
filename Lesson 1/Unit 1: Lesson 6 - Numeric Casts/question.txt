Objectives:
Perform casts between int and double data types in both directions
Understand the difference between a widening conversion and a narrowing conversion
Understand how doubles are truncated when they are converted to ints.
Do now:

1. Given 31, how to get 3 and 1 (/ and %)
2. Given 314, how to get 4,1, 3
3. Given 3.14 how to get decimal portion 14
4. What is output of following code segment.:

double x = 7 / 2;

System.out.println(x);


Programming Activities

Mr. Zeng example:
Ask you enter name and three grades and calculate the average grade
Example format:
Enter name: Peter
Enter first grade in decimal: 98.7
Enter 2nd grade in decimal: 90.0
Enter 3rd grade in decimal: 89.5
Peter 's average grade is (in integer)93


import java.util.Scanner;
public class grade{
        public static void main(String [] args){
                //Declare variables
                String name;
                double grade1, grade2, grade3;
                int avg;

                //create an instance of Scanner class sc
                Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

                //Display message to inform user to enter name and grades
                System.out.println("Enter your name:");
                //input name and grade
                name=sc.nextLine();

                //input grade1
                System.out.println("Enter first grade: ");
                grade1=sc.nextDouble();

                //input 2nd grade
                System.out.println("Enter 2nd grade: ");
                grade2=sc.nextDouble();

                //input 3rd grade
                System.out.println("Enter 3rd grade: ");
                grade3=sc.nextDouble();

                //process data
                avg=(int)((grade1+grade2+grade3)/3+0.5);

                //out average
                System.out.println("Student name: "+name);
                System.out.println("Average grade: "+avg);
        }
}
Your turn:
1. avg=(int)((grade1+grade2+grade3)/3+0.5);

Why +0.5
why use (int)
2. Write a program to input fist_name, last_name and five test grades and print out average grade
