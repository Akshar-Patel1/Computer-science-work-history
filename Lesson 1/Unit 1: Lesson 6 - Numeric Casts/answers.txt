1. Given 31, how to get 3 and 1 (/ and %)
To get 3 you would divide 31 by 10 and to get the 1 you would do 31 % 10 to get 1
2. Given 314, how to get 4,1, 3
To get 3 you would do 314/100
To get 14 you would do 314 / 10 then 31 % 10
To get 4 you would do 314 % 10
3. Given 3.14 how to get decimal portion 14
To get 3.14 you would do 3.14 * 100 then 314 % 100
4. What is output of following code segment.:

double x = 7 / 2;

System.out.println(x);
You would get 3.5



You would use +0.5 to attempt to round it up and use (int) to get the integer instead of getting a decibel

2. Write a program to input fist_name, last_name and five test grades and print out average grade:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main { 

    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter Name:");
        String name = scan.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter first grade in decimal:");
        Double gd1 = scan.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter 2nd grade in decimal: ");
        Double gd2 = scan.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter 3rd grade in decimal: ");
        Double gd3 = scan.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter 4rd grade in decimal: ");
        Double gd4 = scan.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Enter 5rd grade in decimal: ");
        Double gd5 = scan.nextDouble();
        scan.close();
        double avg = (int) (gd1 + gd2 + gd3 + gd4 + gd5) / 5 + 0.5;

      
        System.out.println(name + " 's average grade is: " + (int) avg);
      
    }
}
