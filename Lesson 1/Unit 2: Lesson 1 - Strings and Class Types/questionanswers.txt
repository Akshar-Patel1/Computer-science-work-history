Question 1, what is difference between a and b
a. String name="Peter";
b. String name;
     name="Peter";
2. Why we use the upper case of S in String and 
double, int, char are use lower case in first letter?

The difference between A and B is that A uses 1 line of code while B uses the first line to declare the variable and the second to set something to assign.
String is not a primitive data type while int, double and char are.
